  When all gestures, comments, cursewords, sentences, statements and post is ripped down to its core and its meaning, there is only one thing that matters in the end. The intention. Remembering the word “Intention” will already closed so many doors of treath, disgust, envy, offense, aggresive and negativity. The purpose is not to use the word itself, but to always have it hidden in each communication. Sometimes it is not directly in the sentence itself, but also the body language, voice tone, context and personal relationship with the sender of the communiaction. The intention has to be remembered in both parts, but in the end it’s the revicer, who have to pick up the senders communication and find the right “Intention”.

  This can in some cases be very hard, and especelly if the reciver doesn’t know the sender. As said before what the main things are used to find the intention from the sender, but if you know the person, you most likely know what there intentions are in life and toward you. Or do you? That’s another topic in the article “Don’t guess, know it”. Shortly it is about you cannot know everything, so you cannot take actions from something you don’t know for sure. When we talk about intention in communication there is a part of this knowing. When someone says something to you, that may offent you, you’ll react on it and use their intention against themself. But what if they actually didn’t meant to offent you? Let us start with what they said. They probaly said something that wasn’t that nice to say, but now it the time to think again and ask yourself: Why did they say it? Did they have any purpose of saying it. Both with what they said and how they said it. Why should they express themself exaptly like they did? It could be they didn’t knew how to explain themself but they would really like to tell. There only intention could be to let you know more, give you knowledge or make you aware? This is a typical missunderstanding and in these situations is the intention insensial. They didn’t mean to offend you. Maybe they did, but in the end actually can’t know for sure. Some people you can feel on them; they do it to haunt, but if you aren’t sure, why take the negative decision?

  Let us get something to grasp. Someone is saying your hair looks pretty bad. It first you’re maybe upsed about the comment you just got towards you fresh new cutted hair and thinks it is quite rude to say. But think about what they said. “It looks pretty bad.” Could they have said it in another way? If they said “It is really ugly.” It is more likely they say it to offent you, but pretty bad, is kinda like a way to pack it in, isn’t it? Now ask, why did they say exaplty this and in this way. It seems like they don’t like it, but as said before; the comment is kinda packed in, like if they don’t wanna say it straight to your face. Like they want to be honest with you and tell the truth, but now smoosh it in your face. Then there is to know the person. It is hard to explain this in an example, but I’m sure you know what I am talking about. If the person don’t normaly have the intention to harm people, why should they do it now? Before there is any conclusion there is the last thing; think positive. If you can’t figure out if they do it with a positive or negative intention, just expect them to be the human they are. They are a lovely human who just wanna spread positivity and can make mistakes and flaws like everyone else. The intention is most likely good, otherwise you can feel it on them, that they do it to harm. But don’t let this kick you down. Keep thinking positive. That is the only thing that can kill negativity from others. Most negative comments can be made into fun and positivty. You just gotta use your creativity and find the small light in the darkness. There is always light in even the darkest places.
