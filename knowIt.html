  <h1>Don’t guess, know it</h1>

This topic is inspired from what my dad always said (direct translation from Danish): “You shall not believe, you shall know.” which can be translated to “You cannot guess, you have to know.”
<br>
It is important to think about this sentence in the right way, otherwise it’ll be used in the wrong contexts.
<br><br>
The first thought to this sentence is that you have to be sure of what you do and what you think. That there is no guessing, no trying and no seeing where it goes. That you have to make a path, you know is right to take and that there is no room for any mistakes. This is NOT how I think the sentence should be used.
<br><br>
This sentence can be used in two situations, but it is important it is only used in one of them. The wrong situation, where it should not be used is when the actions are made directly from your decisions and your decisions only. This is when you take a decision that doesn’t need other people accept. In these situations there is room for mistakes, guesses, blind actions and unknown decisions. You can do things without having the full knowledge of them and guess your way to an answer. You still have to think before your decisions will have an impact on other people, but these situations are just about taking the decision yourself. This could be which study you have to start on or if you should move and you already live alone. These decisions are only yours to take and there is no right answer, so you can just take chances if you'd like to.
<br><br>
The right situation, where this sentence should be used is, when your decision isn’t only yours to make. Maybe you can take the decision, but if there’s other people than you to take the decision as well, with you then “You shall not guess, but you shall know”.
<br>
You can’t take actions from guessing the answer yourself in these situations. You cannot think something is right, because that’s just what you thought. You can feel your stomach to take a decision, but if there actually is a way to figure out the right answer, don’t just guess it. Go find the answer and act from that instead of just guessing it. You can’t think something is true, just because you thought yourself to it our because you heard it from someone random. This could be if you should stop talking to a friend, because they don’t wanna talk with out anymore or you should move away from your roommate, because they don’t like to live with you. These two situations is typical in life, but made up in your head. Here there is a right answer, if your friend still wanna talk or your roommate likes to live with you or not. Don’t guess what they think and act from that. Figure out what is behind all of this. Maybe they think the same and when it comes to an end, they think you’re the one who don’t like their company. The guessing hole. The hole that come from guessing and not actually knowing the truth. So see if you can hear my dad’s voice in you head next time you think maybe they don’t .. “You cannot guess, you have to know.”
